Blogging is all about content. To put simply, Content is King. To put curiously, content is the **_Bee's Knees_** (Checkout the disputed origin of this idiom [here](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-bees-knees.html)).

I will primarily be focused on writing about techie things; however, I plan to include posts about the many thoughts about life in general that otherwise might escape my memory.

Stay tuned, Word Wide Web!
