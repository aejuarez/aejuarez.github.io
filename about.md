I am a recent college graduate interested in web design, development, and computer networks. At Central Washington University, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Administrative Management. 

The career path I want to pursue is one where I get to make work that matters, actively listen, and collaborate with those around me. The purpose of this site is to share thoughts and ideas that pique my interest, and to showcase my character and talents. 

Seattle is my home, where I have recently moved after experiencing the first 24 years of my life in Eastern Washington. Thanks for stopping by!
