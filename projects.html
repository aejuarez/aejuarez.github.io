#### Chess Enthusiast: IT 422 Final Project

Created an informational website using basic HTML and CSS 
for a fictitious chess club. [Mr. Chuck Wahle] (http://www.cwu.edu/~cwahle) graded this as a 
final project for his Website Construction course in the spring of 2013.

I also created a repository for this project on my [GitHub Account]. (https://github.com/aejuarez/Chess-Enthusiast)
